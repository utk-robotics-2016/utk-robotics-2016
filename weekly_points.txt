NOTES:
9/9/15: We could only run from the version B orientation; therefore, we could not go through the tunnel on a version A board.

9/16/15: Serial communication issues between the BBB and the robot's microcontrollers caused to robot to stop functioning properly. Issue is being investigated. 

9/23/15: Serial communication bug fixed. Velcotiy PID motor control has been added, but the movement is still being debugged. This resulted in dominate.py not being updated, so the robot could move but not yet through the tunnel. 

9/30/15: We "randomly" drew version 2 all three times, but it also works on version 1. Navigation was done with dead reckoning and the new PID movement code. The robot correctly drives from the start square to each of the block zones (A, B, and C) and then to the sea zone when the robot is run on a version 2 course. Version 1 stll would score 50 points, but the other navigation is not working as well in that orientation. 

10/7/15: ... 

10/14/15: The robot is able to move about the course to drop off the blue blocks in the sea zone and deposit the colored blocks in the rail zone, but the loader is not ready to be used without a person interveneing to move the blocks onto the loader.

10/21/15: No test today.

10/28/15: The loader now works mostly. There are issues with the flaps on the loader getting stuck and not fully loading all of the blocks. Version 1 (or A) was untested prior to this, but the robot partially worked in this configuration. 

11/4/15: Run #1 - Robot had some navigation difficulties due to change from keyframe to trapezoid function. The robot also failed to properly load all of the zone A blocks. We stopped to fix issues, so we only ran one test. 

11/11/15: Run #1 (rail zone right) - Loader failure due to the flap not being bent enough. Successfully transported 9 blocks to the sea zone, but we deposited one block outside the course area (unsure of effect on scoring). Run #2 (rail zone right) - Essentially a perfect run - all 16 zone A blocks landed in the sea zone. Run #3 (rail zone left) - Loader failed by running the arm into the barge - miraculously we still transported a single black successfully.

11/18/15: Run #1 - A certain team member did not load proper competition code. Failure. Run #2 - Loader failure resulted in an e stop which terminated dominate.py. Run #3 - Loader arm failed during the loading process causing only a partial load, and then the arm couldn't push out so some blocks were left unloaded.
