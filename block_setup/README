------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Compilation Directions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just run the makefile on a Mac or Linux computer.

On Windows, open the Visual Studio solution file in Visual Studio 2013, and
the project should build. If you run into any issues, let me know. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Running Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just execute the compiled executable.

./block_setup
./block_setup (seed)

The output is currently more for any debugging purposes. A graphical output
feature is coming. The program only outputs the generated configuration for
Zone B and Zone C because Zone A is uniform and is pointless to generate.

 About input.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file houses the "database" of available blocks.

The format is as follows:
(size) (color)\n

Valid sizes are large and small.
Valid colors are red, blue, yellow, and green.

The current parsing mechanism currently is not very robust, so extraneous input
could result in undefined program behavior.

The provided input.txt is based upon the pictured blocks in the published rules
document.
